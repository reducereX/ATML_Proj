# Logit-Weighted Supervised Contrastive Representation Distillation (LW-SupCRD)

## Project Overview
This project implements and evaluates **Logit-Weighted Supervised Contrastive Representation Distillation (LW-SupCRD)**, a novel knowledge distillation framework that combines supervised contrastive learning with teacher-guided semantic weighting on CIFAR-100.

**Key Innovation:** Uses teacher logits to semantically weight contrastive forces, achieving superior representation learning compared to standard supervised contrastive methods.

### **Comprehensive Experimental Results**

#### 1. **Alpha (α) Sweep - Pull Force Weighting**
*Configuration: β=10, τ=0.07, adaptive β*

| α | Test Acc | Δ vs SupCon | Alignment ↓ | Uniformity ↓ | Observation |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **1.0** | **73.19%** | **+4.11%** | 1.1518 | **-3.7027** | ✅ Optimal balance |
| 2.0 | 71.78% | +2.70% | **1.1129** | -3.6744 | Tighter clusters → worse uniformity |
| 5.0 | 70.67% | +1.59% | 1.1589 | -3.6712 | Over-clustering |
| 10.0 | 70.07% | +0.99% | 1.2754 | -3.6728 | Severe over-clustering |

**Finding:** α=1 optimal - higher α causes tighter clusters, sacrificing uniformity and causing overfitting.

---

#### 2. **Beta (β) Sweep - Push Force Strength**
*Configuration: α=1, τ=0.07, adaptive β*

| β | Test Acc | Δ vs SupCon | Alignment ↓ | Uniformity ↓ | Observation |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **10.0** | **73.19%** | **+4.11%** | **1.1518** | **-3.7027** | ✅ Optimal - strong push |
| 12.0 | 71.31% | +2.23% | 1.2068 | -3.6654 | Too strong → degradation |
| 5.0 | 70.63% | +1.55% | 1.2487 | -3.6785 | Weak push → poor separation |
| 1.0 | 70.46% | +1.38% | 1.1862 | -3.6390 | Very weak push |

**Finding:** β=10 optimal - balances strong class separation with stable training. Too high causes instability, too low fails to separate classes.

---

#### 3. **Temperature (τ) Sweep - Gradient Sharpness**
*Configuration: α=1, β=10, adaptive β*

| τ | Test Acc | Δ vs SupCon | Alignment ↓ | Uniformity ↓ | Observation |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **0.07** | **73.35%** | **+4.27%** | 1.1990 | **-3.7104** | ✅ Optimal - balanced spread |
| 0.05 | 68.08% | -1.00% | 1.3503 | -3.6645 | Too sharp → poor alignment |

**Finding:** τ=0.07 provides optimal gradient flow - τ=0.05 too sharp, only closest pairs contribute.

---

#### 4. **Hybrid Loss (λ) Sweep - SupCon + LW-SupCRD Mix**
*Formula: `L = λ × SupCon + (1-λ) × LW-SupCRD`*
*Configuration: α=1, β=10, τ=0.07*

| λ | Test Acc | Train Acc | Gap | Alignment ↓ | Uniformity ↓ | Observation |
|---|----------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **0.3** | **72.58%** | 98.73% | **26.15%** | **0.6043** | -3.2880 | Best hybrid - severe overfitting |
| 0.5 | 72.07% | 98.92% | 26.85% | **0.5166** | -2.9451 | Worse overfitting |
| 0.7 | 71.57% | 98.25% | 26.68% | **0.4845** | -2.8290 | Poor uniformity |
| 0.9 | 70.69% | 95.40% | 24.71% | **0.4394** | -2.6273 | Approaching pure SupCon |

**Critical Finding:** All hybrids show massive overfitting (24-27% gap) despite excellent alignment. **Pure LW-SupCRD (73.35%) beats best hybrid (72.58%)** - adding SupCon only adds noise.

---

## Key Findings

### **1. The Alignment-Uniformity Trade-off for CIFAR-100** 📊

For fine-grained classification (100 classes), **uniformity is more critical than tight alignment:**

**Best Methods (73%+):**
- Alignment: ~1.15-1.20 (moderate clusters)
- Uniformity: ~-3.70 (excellent spread)
- Strategy: Trade cluster tightness for class separation

**Worst Methods (68%-):**
- Alignment: ~0.44-0.66 (very tight clusters)
- Uniformity: ~-2.50 to -1.73 (poor spread)
- Problem: Over-clustering causes poor separation

**Counter-intuitive Insight:** Student's "worse" alignment (1.20 vs teacher's 0.59) actually helps generalization by maintaining better class separation on the hypersphere.

---

### **2. Hyperparameter Roles & Interactions**

**α (Pull Weight) - Semantic Confidence:**
- Controls cluster tightness via teacher probabilities
- α=1 optimal: Minimal semantic weighting
- Higher α → tighter clusters → worse uniformity → overfitting
- Effect: Primarily degrades uniformity

**β (Push Weight) - Negative Force Strength:**
- Controls class separation strength
- β=10 optimal: Strong push forces
- Critical discovery: Affects **both** alignment AND uniformity simultaneously
- Unlike α, strong β improves both metrics

**τ (Temperature) - Gradient Sharpness:**
- Controls exponential scaling in similarity
- τ=0.07 optimal: Balanced gradient flow
- τ=0.05 too sharp: Only nearest neighbors contribute
- Effect: Primarily affects uniformity

**Adaptive β - Curriculum Learning:**
- Early epochs (uncertain): β_eff = 1.25β (stronger push)
- Late epochs (confident): β_eff = 0.71β (weaker push)
- Provides natural hard negative mining

---

### **3. Why Hybrids Fail** ❌

All hybrid losses (λ=0.3 to 0.9) show:
- ✓ Excellent alignment (0.44-0.60, like teacher)
- ✗ Poor uniformity (-2.6 to -3.3)
- ✗ Massive overfitting (24-27% train-test gap)
- ✗ Lower accuracy than pure LW-SupCRD

**Root Cause:** SupCon's pull-only forces create over-tight clusters, sacrificing the uniformity that LW-SupCRD's strong push forces (β=10) achieve.

**Conclusion:** Pure LW-SupCRD (73.35%) > Best Hybrid (72.58%)

---

### **4. Student Surpasses Teacher in Uniformity** 🎯

| Metric | Teacher | Best Student | Observation |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Alignment | **0.5928** | 1.1990 | Student 2× looser |
| Uniformity | -3.4649 | **-3.7104** | Student 7% better |
| Accuracy | 80.75% | 73.35% | Reasonable gap |

**Key Insight:** Student trades alignment for uniformity and still outperforms all baselines significantly. The looser clusters + better spread = superior linear separability.

---

### **5. Gradient Normalization Critical** ⚙️

The `/α` normalization in the loss prevents gradient saturation:
- Without: α=2 causes exponentials ~exp(20) = 4.8×10⁸
- With: Allows proper α scaling without optimization collapse
- Enables exploration of α>1 configurations

This fix was essential for all α sweep experiments to work.

---

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Teacher:** ResNet-50 (23.5M parameters, 80.75% accuracy)
- **Student:** ResNet-18 (11.2M parameters)
- **Projection:** 2048-dim backbone → 64-dim contrastive space
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-100 (100 classes, 50k train / 10k test)
- **Training:** 50 epochs, batch size 128, Adam optimizer (lr=1e-3)

### Loss Functions

#### 1. **Baseline SupCon** (Khosla et al., 2020)
Standard supervised contrastive learning - pull positives only.

#### 2. **Baseline CRD** (Tian et al., 2020)
Contrastive Representation Distillation - instance matching.

#### 3. **LW-SupCRD** (Ours)
Logit-weighted supervised contrastive with adaptive forces:

```python
# Pull weight (semantic confidence)
w_pull = α × p_teacher(correct_class)

# Push weight (inverse adaptive)
if adaptive_beta:
    β_effective = β / (p_target + 0.5)
    w_push = β_effective × (1 - p_teacher(negative_class))
else:
    w_push = β × (1 - p_teacher(negative_class))

# Gradient normalization
loss = -log((w_pull × pos_exp) / (w_pull × pos_exp + w_push × neg_exp))
loss = loss / α  # CRITICAL: prevents gradient saturation
```

#### 4. **Hybrid Loss**
```python
L = λ × L_SupCon + (1 - λ) × L_LW-SupCRD
```
Best: λ=0.3, but still underperforms pure LW-SupCRD.

## Visualization & Analysis

### Alignment & Uniformity Metrics (Wang & Isola, 2020)

**Alignment Loss (↓ better):**
```
L_align = E[||f(x) - f(x+)||²]
```
Measures positive pair distance - lower = tighter clusters.

**Uniformity Loss (↓ better, more negative):**
```
L_uniform = log(E[exp(-2||f(x) - f(y)||²)])
```
Measures hypersphere coverage - more negative = better spread.

### Available Visualizations
